# AniFlow
A Personalized Anime Recommendation System

## Developers
Christopher Lu, Lucius Garavaglia, Varun Pitlam

## Introduction
As anime viewers continue to watch, the pool of shows to watch seem to get smaller and smaller even though there are thousands to choose from.  This problem is due to the focus on mainstream popular shows being recommended foremost and little to no outreach of smaller shows.  AniFlow solves this by providing personalized recommendations to help users discover their next favorite anime without searching online for hours just to find the right one to watch.

## Objectives
- Design a recommendation system that provides personalized anime suggestions based on their watch history and ratings.
- Develop a web-based application that allows users to create an account, build a watchlist, log watched shows, and rate them.
- Implement a system that gives recommendations based on factors like genre, star ratings, and show similarities.
- Provide suggestions to users about shows they are likely to enjoy using a logic-based filtering system.

## Scope
This application will act like most with user registration(password,email) but also include a watchlist, user ratings, searchable anime database, user picks(highly rated and/or watched through), and a personalized row of recommended anime. The system will not work on mobile devices or involve large-scale deployment to thousands of concurrent users.

## Proposed Solution
The system is a web application that allows users to track the anime they have watched and rate them. The application then uses this collected data to generate personalized recommendations on what anime to watch next. These recommendations are based on algorithms that analyze the user's ratings and viewing history, and match it against a database of anime using attributes like genre, themes, and popularity. The target users are anime fans of all levels who want a more efficient and personalized way to discover new content.
